# Grasshopper DesignStudio

This is a decompilation and improvement of Provo Craft's Cricut DesignStudio. All rights and copyright goes to them. However, they have not supported the software since at least 2013. The first and second generation Cricut machines are no longer supported and no longer work with any supported software. This repo is an attempt to keep older Cricut machines working and out of landfills.

The software has been decompiled with [ILSpy](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy) and rebuilt with newer versions of .net. The original program was .net 2.0, and the versions provided are .net 4.7 and 4.8. Choose 4.7 for Windows 7 and 4.8 for Windows 10 and 11.

## Installation

Go to Releases and download the version for your operating system. Only the new binary is provided. You need the original program installer to use. It is available on the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20130510081648/http://mirror.cricut.com/cds/fontpack/CDS_10404220.exe).
You can either install the software or extract the installer with [Universal Extractor](https://github.com/Bioruebe/UniExtract2) or [7Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html).
Overwrite the executable with the version from this repository.
